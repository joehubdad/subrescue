# subrescue

My project repository for Submarine Rescue 2022 releases.  Since March 2022 the progress on Submarine Rescue has progressed more rapidly than the previous 6 months.

Some key features in Submarine Rescue:
  - Custom GUI features (trim bubble indicator, custom gage meters)
  - Customized hose design using a modified version of the rigid body 2D chain code
  - Unique hose reel system which keeps tension on the hose during game play
  - 2D Platformer game uses prebuilt ocean floors and randomly selects the floors and depth for each game play session
  - 2D submarine rescue platformer uses Area2D/Collision shapes to apply ocean current forces to various bodies in play
